class TtcpCient

This class will do a few tasks.

struct hbs //header'd byte sequence
{
    int length;
    char *start;
};

TtcpClient client;
these calls return false on failure and true on success

client.ipConnect("192.168.1.183", 1111); takes presentation char* format ip address and port number
client.sendData(hbuf); // hbuf is a struct hbs. will send the buffer specified in hbuf
client.dynamicReceive(hbuf, 8192); will receive 8192 bytes into a dynamically allocated buffer, and return info to hbuf,
dynamically allocated buffer is capped at a max of 8192 bytes in this scenario.
